# Enigma Frisbee Website

This is a static file site, hosted at [enigmafrisbee.com](https://enigmafrisbee.com), which allows it to be hosted (for free) on GitHub pages.
There's no server, anything dynamic has to happen in Javascript and the files have to be served statically from the repo.

## Modifying Text

When it comes to changing the site's contents, it's as easy as it seems: change the text as you see it in `index.html`, then committing the changes to the GitHub repository.


## Domain Name

The domain name must be renewed annually. I highly recommend leaving it on auto-renew. It can be changed under Settings > Pages. There are some changes that
must be made on the domain name side, but you should be able to just follow the instructions linked on the GitHub page by going to the provider you bought the domain from.


## Development Details

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) is used for the static design. Bootstrap provides a lot of `class`-based attributes that make it pretty easy
to quickly make something that looks resonable (hopefully?)
