# Enigma Frisbee Website

This is a static file site, which allows it to be hosted (for free) on GitHub pages.
There's no server, anything dynamic has to happen in Javascript and the files have to be served statically from the repo.

## Modifying Text

When it comes to changing the site's contents, it's as easy as it seems: change the text as you see it in `index.html`, then committing the changes to the GitHub repository.


## Development Details

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) is used for the static design. Bootstrap provides a lot of `class`-based attributes that make it pretty easy
to quickly make something that looks resonable (hopefully?)
